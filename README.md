Unsupervised learning algorithms 
These are set of algorithms which are used when there is no target variable present.
We have no one for supervision thats why it is named as UNSUPERVISED learning .
These algorithms search for patterns,simillarities and on that basis they form clusters.
These algorithms are writen considering dataset in Euclidian space .
