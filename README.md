Unsupervised learning algorithms:-
These are set of algorithms which are used when there is no target variable present.
We have no one for supervision thats why it is named as UNSUPERVISED learning .
These algorithms search for patterns,simillarities and on that basis they form clusters.![1-what-is-clustering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72375504/146517825-3169a903-0c81-4341-b7da-fd1fb4e6835a.png)

These algorithms are writen considering dataset in Euclidian space .
