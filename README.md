Unsupervised learning algorithms:-
1) Clustering 
2) Association 


These are sets of algorithms which are used when there is no target variable present.
These algorithms are writen considering dataset in Euclidian space .
We have no one for supervision thats why it is named as UNSUPERVISED learning .
Clustering : These algorithms search for patterns,simillarities and on that basis they form clusters.
